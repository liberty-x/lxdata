# LX Data

Please find our application [here](). (To be linked).

## Who?

You thought LX Riddle :question: was the finale. You were so *so* wrong.

From the same team who brought you such hits as LX News :newspaper: and LX Search :mag:, Liberty-X, a team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy, brings you **LX Data**.

Our crack team is formed of members Justen Barget, Rachel Black, Huw Davies and Ruth Uwemedimo.

## What?

LX Data will be a data visualisation page where you can search tube lines and explore data supplied by the [TFL API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). We are conducting this project during the 6th week of the course, the focus of which is **front-end design**.

## Why?

We are exploring the use of **data visualisation** libraries such a [D3](http://d3js.org/) and [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) on our web page. We will be reinforcing our knowledge of handling APIs, since we will be using the TFL's one for this project. We have previously used Instagram's and the Guardian's APIs [here](https://github.com/liberty-x/lxnews).

### Whiteboard wireframes!

![whiteboard](https://files.gitter.im/RachelBLondon/libert-x/seWD/rsz_whiteboardwireframe.jpg)

Our search bar will take a valid tube line as an input which will query the TFL API.

Our 'Tab 1 Content' will be a 'tube-crystal', which will display the interlinked stations of a searched tube line. To see what we ~~ripped off~~ were inspired by, look [here](https://github.com/Crystal-Clear/codecrystal).

Our 'Tab 2 Content' will be a comparison graph of the 5 largest stations on the given tube line, in a similar fashion to the 'Github compare' graph on the FAC6 readme found [here](https://github.com/FAC6/book/blob/master/patterns/week6/chartjs.md).
